# Crossbar.io for Docker

Crossbar.io for Docker is available from the official Dockerhub repository [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/crossbario/crossbar/).

The Docker images are built from a Debian Jessie base image and then simply install Crossbar.io from our own binary package repositories for Debian/Ubuntu.

> Because of the above approach, Docker images for Crossbar.io are always current, and hence only need republishing when the image build process steps change.
